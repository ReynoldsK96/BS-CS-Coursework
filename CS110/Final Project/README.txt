Explanation: My program generates a character based on character traits found in the 
game Elder Scrolls Online. The user may generate any number of characters they wish, 
input 3 numbers, and then my program will decide the role, gender, race, and class the 
character should be a print it to a text file. My program generates a character based

How to run the program: You need both FinalProject.java and CharacterTraits.jave for this
program to work. When you run the program you will be required to input several values.
You will be asked if you wish to run this program. You can either respond yes or no. 
If you respond yes, you will need to input three numbers (one at a time). You will be 
asked first to provide a large number to be used to generate the random number used in 
multiple two character trait generator methods. You will then need to input two more numbers
(again one at a time). These two numbers can be anything, even a number with a decimal.
These numbers will be used in another character trait generator method. 

Known bugs: If you input a large number that exceeds the possible integer value.
